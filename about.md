### Professional Life

I'm an enthusiastic Cloud and Clojure developer working at [Metosin](http://www.metosin.fi/) (see also: [My First Weeks at Metosin!]({% post_url 2020-03-23-my-first-weeks-at-metosin %})). Before Metosin I had a long corporate career at the [Tieto Corporation](https://www.tietoevry.com/) where I worked in various roles, the last role being a [Cloud Mentor](https://www.tietoevry.com/en/blog/2019/07/reinventing-oneself-professionally--the-story-of-a-cloud-specialist/).

I have done work in all major clouds, though most of my experience is with AWS. I have the following cloud certifications:
- [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate](https://www.youracclaim.com/badges/7e21adbd-591a-4ba0-8882-c2bd1857ce22/public_url)

I have experience creating cloud infra code using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and cloud native tools like [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

### Software as a Hobby

I do various cloud and Clojure exercises in my free time mostly to learn new cloud related technologies and programming practices. I'm especially thrilled with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - the main reason I decided to leave my long corporate career and join Metosin. Even though Clojure is my favorite programming language, I have used e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript and Clojure in production, and used e.g. Go and Kotlin in my pet projects (if you are interested how I feel about those languages you might like to read [Five Languages - Five Stories]({% post_url 2018-11-19-five-languages-five-stories %}))

I write new blog articles regarding my latest exercises, and also about interesting technologies I have had a chance to use in my day job.

### Freetime

When I'm off duty I like to walk with Miska in the [Helsinki Central Park](https://www.hel.fi/hel2/keskuspuisto/eng/1centralpark/).

Some pictures taken from our trips.
