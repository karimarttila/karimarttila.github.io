*Kari and his best friend Miska the Samoyed.*


I'm an enthusiastic Cloud and Clojure developer working at [Metosin](http://www.metosin.fi/).

I do various cloud and Clojure exercises in my free time mostly to learn new cloud related technologies and programming practices. I'm especially thrilled with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - the main reason I decided to leave my long corporate career and join Metosin. I try to write new blog articles regarding those exercises, and also some interesting technologies I have had a chance to use in my day work.

When I'm off duty I like to walk with Miska in the [Helsinki Central Park](https://www.hel.fi/hel2/keskuspuisto/eng/1centralpark/).

You can find my blog articles in the [main page](../index.html).
