*Kari and his best friend Miska the Samoyed.*

### Professional Life

I'm an enthusiastic Cloud and Clojure developer working at [Metosin](http://www.metosin.fi/). Before Metosin I had a long corporate career at the [Tieto Corporation](https://www.tietoevry.com/) where I worked in various roles, last role being a Cloud Mentor.

I have done work in all major clouds, though most of my experience is with AWS. I have the following cloud certifications:
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate
- AWS Certified Developer Associate
- AWS Certified SysOps Administrator Associate
- Google Cloud Certified Associate Cloud Engineer
- Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Architect
- Microsoft Certified Azure Solutions Architect Expert

I have experience creating cloud infra code using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) and cloud native tools like [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

### Software as a Hobby

I do various cloud and Clojure exercises in my free time mostly to learn new cloud related technologies and programming practices. I'm especially thrilled with [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - the main reason I decided to leave my long corporate career and join Metosin. Even though Clojure is my favorite programming language, I have used e.g. C, C++, Java, Python, Javascript and Clojure in production, and used e.g. Go and Kotlin in my pet projects (if you are interested how I feel about those languages you might like to read [Five Languages - Five Stories]({% post_url 2018-11-19-five-languages-five-stories %}))

I try to write new blog articles regarding my latest exercises, and also about interesting technologies I have had a chance to use in my day work.

### Freetime

When I'm off duty I like to walk with Miska in the [Helsinki Central Park](https://www.hel.fi/hel2/keskuspuisto/eng/1centralpark/).

Some picture taken from our trips.
